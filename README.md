# More Modals

## Description
A Warmup assignment to practice some of the JavaScript needed for the upcoming Profile Creator project.

## Requirements

### Content
1. Make the following changes in the provided `<form>`:
	1. Remove the `<p>` element.
	2. Create a `<textarea>` element and give it an `id` and the `required` attribute.
	3. Create a `<button type="submit">` with the text Submit and give it an `id`.
2. Add an `id` to the provided `<h1>` element.

>*Your modal will take precedence over the entire page when it is open. You can temporarily manage the modal's state by commenting/un-commenting `showModal()` in the JavaScript file.*

### Styling
No styling is required for this assignment.

### Interactivity
1. Declare variables for the following:
	1. The `<textarea>` element.
	2. The submit `<button>`.
	3. The `<h1>` element.
2. Define a function named `transferText` that does the following:
	1. Sets the `innerText` property of the `<h1>` element to `value` of the `<textarea>` element.
	2. Closes the modal using the `closeModal()` method.
3. Add an event listener to the submit button that will be triggered by a `"click"` and call the `transferText` function. The result should be that any text entered in the `<textarea>` input will populate the `<h1>` element upon form submission.

## Submission
1. Make sure that your code is [formatted using the built-in formatting tools](https://ims322.ersheff.com/docs/style-guide.html#formatting).
2. In the Source Control panel of VS Code:
	1. Stage all changes by clicking the + next to Changes.
	2. Enter "finished" as a commit message and click the Commit button.
	3. The Commit button should change to a Sync Changes button. Click this to finish syncing the latest changes to your GitHub Repository.
3. Return to your assignment repository on GitHub.
	1. Go to Settings and navigate to the Pages section.
	2. Under Branch, choose "main" and click Save.
	3. After a few moments, if you refresh this page, there should now be a URL near the top next to a Visit Site button. If you click this button, you should see your site open in a new window.
4. Copy the URL generated by GitHub Pages, paste it in the Website URL field of the corresponding Canvas Assignment, and click Submit Assignment.

## Grading
